# Redux News App

Developed with React.js and Redux Library. News data are fetched from a RESTful API, and displayed in a card container. This project is a sample use of Redux.
Redux-thunk is applied to show the benefit of Middleware, which returns a JavaScript object from response, with type and payload for the dispatch action. 
Material UI is used for styling.
